        There are 2 steps to this:
        1. Generate bombs randomly
        2. Generate all the adjacent values in a grid
        
        For step 1:
        - Create a loop that goes until there are no more bombs to place
        - Within that, iterate through the entire 2D array and place bombs
            - To place a bomb randomly, this should be a 1 in 10 chance to place a bomb
                - All bombs should be the value 9
            - Make sure to not place bombs on bombs that are already there
            - When a bomb is placed, make sure to track that for your outer loop
        - This should loop through the 2D array over and over until ALL bombs have been placed
        
        For step 2:
        - Loop through the 2D array
            - For every bomb, call the add adjacent method,
